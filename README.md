## 🔹 Project Overview
**AI-Powered Personalized Medicine Recommender System** developed by **Mazhar Ali – Senior AI & Healthcare Developer**.  

This system predicts patient risk levels and recommends **personalized treatment plans** by integrating:

- Genetic data (DNA markers, variants)  
- Electronic Health Records (EHR, medical history)  
- Real-time wearable data (heart rate, glucose levels, activity)  

It helps doctors and patients make **data-driven, precision healthcare decisions**.

## 🚀 Features
- Merge and process multi-source healthcare data (genetic + EHR + wearable)  
- Machine Learning models for **treatment outcome prediction**  
- Interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time recommendations  
- Modular, extensible, and production-ready structure  
- Ready to integrate **real**
